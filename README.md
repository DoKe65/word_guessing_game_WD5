# Game Show App
This is the 5th project for the Treehouse Web Developement Techdegree.

## Goal
Creating a virtual version of "Wheel of Fortune" with javascript, where the player has to guess random phrases. The HTML and CSS were already provided, no changes were made to the html, but I added some styling enhancements.

Have fun!
